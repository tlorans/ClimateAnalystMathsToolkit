# Part 1: Matrix Algebra

In this part, I cover the first main tool needed as a climate analyst: matrix algebra. We closely follow the corresponding textbook from Chasnov (2018) {cite:p}`chasnov2018matrix`, adding Python codes snippets. 

I strongly think that Python codes implementation will facilitate and dedramatize the maths involved in this course, even for those of you who are not confortable with. There is no such things as "people bad in maths".

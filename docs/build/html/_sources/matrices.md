## Matrices

In this part, we will cover the concept of matrices. We will define matrices, how to operate with, review some particular matrices (identity matrix for example), learn about transposes and inverses, and see the orthogonal and permutation matrices. All of this will be used later in the optimization part. Matrices are particularly important for a climate analyst, from emissions factor estimates with input-output matrices to portfolio optimization problem formulation.

## Linear Programming 

Every linear program (LP) has linear constraints and a linear objective. Using particular solver, requires a particular form. We need to undersand how to manipulate a linear program in order to fit the form required by solvers.

### Linear and Affine Functions

Let's first define what linear and affine functions are.

A function $f(x_1,..., x_m)$ is linear in the variables $x_1, ..., x_m$ if there exists constants $a_1, ... , a_m$ such that:

\begin{equation}
f(x_1,..., x_m) = a_1x_1 + ... + a_mx_m =
a^Tx
\end{equation}

This is basically a dot product. 

A function $f(x_1,..., x_m)$ is affine in the variables $x_1, ..., x_m$ if there exist constants $b$, $a_1, ... , a_m$ such that:


\begin{equation}
f(x_1,..., x_m) = a_0 + a_1x_1 + ... + a_mx_m =
a^Tx + b
\end{equation}

This is basically a dot product plus a constant.

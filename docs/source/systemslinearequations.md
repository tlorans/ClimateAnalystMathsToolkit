## Systems of Linear Equations 

In this part, we are going to see how to solve a system of linear equations with linear algebra. 

This is particularly useful to understand how an optimization problem can be modelled in matrix forms and these technics are especially useful for estimating emissions factors with input-output matrices.

### Gaussian Elimination

### Reduced Row Echelon Norm

### Computing Inverses 

### Elementary Matrices

### LU Decomposition

### Solving (LU)x = b

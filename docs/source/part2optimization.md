# Part 2: Optimization

In this part, we will introduce optimization from a modelling perspective, following [this course](https://laurentlessard.com/teaching/524-intro-to-optimization/) from Laurent Lessard. Starting from Linear Programming, we will build the foundations for understanding Quadratic Programming. This will be particularly useful in formulating portfolio optimization problems.
